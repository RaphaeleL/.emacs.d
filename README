# Lira - Emacs Configuration Framework

A modern, modular Emacs configuration framework with CLI management tools.

## Quick Start

Just download this repo and open Emacs. The rest should be done automatically.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/RaphaeleL/.emacs.d
```

## CLI Commands

Lira includes a command-line interface for managing your Emacs configuration:

### Installation

```bash
# Install the CLI tool
make install-cli
```

### Available Commands

- `lira health` - Check the health of your Lira configuration
- `lira test` - Run tests on your Lira configuration  
- `lira restart` - Clean and restart Emacs (deletes elpa, eln-cache, etc.)
- `lira uninstall` - Completely remove Lira configuration and clean up
- `lira nuke` - Alias for uninstall - completely remove everything
- `lira help` - Show help message

### Examples

```bash
# Check if everything is working correctly
lira health

# Run configuration tests
lira test

# Clean restart Emacs (useful after updates)
lira restart

# Completely remove Lira (with confirmation)
lira uninstall

# Same as uninstall, but more dramatic
lira nuke
```

### Uninstalling the CLI

```bash
# Remove the CLI command
make uninstall-cli
```
