# Configuration of my Emacs

Just Download this Repo and open Emacs. The Rest should be done automatically.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/RaphaeleL/.emacs.d
```

A more minimal Emacs configuration can be found in [`init.term.el`](init.term.el) and could be started with

```bash
emacs -q -l ~/.emacs.d/init.term.el
```
